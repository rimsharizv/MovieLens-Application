# MovieLens Application
Author: Rimsha Rizvi

## Description
The MovieLens Application is a Python-based program that utilizes the MovieLens database to provide users with the ability to retrieve and update information about movies. The application follows an N-tier design, with a user interface tier, a business logic tier, and a data access tier. The user interface tier handles user input and output, the business logic tier contains the functions that perform the main actions of the application, and the data access tier interacts with the MovieLens database.

## Files:
1. **main.py**: The main file of the application, responsible for handling user input and output, as well as calling the appropriate functions from the business logic tier (objecttier) based on the user's commands.
2. **objecttier.py:** The business logic tier of the application, containing functions that perform the main actions of the application, such as retrieving and updating movie information.
3. **datatier.py:** The data access tier of the application, containing functions that interact with the MovieLens database.
4. **MovieLens.db:** The SQLite database file containing the MovieLens dataset.
